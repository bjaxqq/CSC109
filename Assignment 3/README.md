# Assignment 3

## Assignment Instructions

For this assignment, you will be practicing some fundamental Git and GitHub commands/procedures â€“
creating a new Git repository, making changes to the repository, creating versions of the repository
(commits), and propagating those changes to GitHub. I recommend that you take things slow and be
very deliberate with what steps you are taking and commands you are executing.
