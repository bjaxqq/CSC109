## Assignment Instructions

Your group is tasked with creating an application that imitates a vending machine. Both members of
your group will need to contribute to this application. One group member will create the remote repo
on GitHub, and both group members must have a copy of the repo from GitHub on their own computers
in order to commit and push changes. No group member is allowed to commit twice in a row. This
means that when looking at the commit history for your groupâ€™s GitHub repo, I should not see the same
person committing sequentially.
